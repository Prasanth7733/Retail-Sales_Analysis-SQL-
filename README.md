# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help beginners develop their SQL skills by analyzing retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions using SQL queries. Itâ€™s a great starting point for those looking to build a strong foundation in data analysis and SQL.

## Objectives

1. **Database Setup**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing or null values in the dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to derive insights and answer key business questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: A database named `p1_retail_db` is created to store the retail sales data.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is designed to store transaction details, including sale dates, customer information, product categories, quantities, prices, and total sales.

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Identify the number of unique customers in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: List all unique product categories available in the dataset.
- **Null Value Handling**: Check for null values in the dataset and clean the data by removing incomplete records.

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The project focuses on answering key business questions through SQL queries. These include analyzing sales trends, identifying top-performing categories, understanding customer demographics, and evaluating high-value transactions. The analysis provides actionable insights into sales performance and customer behavior.

## Business Questions

The following business questions are addressed in this project:

1. **Daily Sales Analysis**: Retrieve all sales transactions made on a specific date (e.g., '2022-11-05').
2. **Category-Specific Sales**: Identify transactions where a specific category (e.g., 'Clothing') had a high quantity sold (e.g., more than 4 units) during a particular month (e.g., November 2022).
3. **Total Sales by Category**: Calculate the total sales for each product category.
4. **Customer Demographics**: Find the average age of customers who purchased items from a specific category (e.g., 'Beauty').
5. **High-Value Transactions**: Identify all transactions where the total sale amount exceeds a specific threshold (e.g., 1000).
6. **Gender-Based Sales**: Determine the total number of transactions made by each gender in each product category.
7. **Monthly Sales Trends**: Calculate the average sales for each month and identify the best-selling month in each year.
8. **Top Customers**: Identify the top 5 customers based on their total purchase amounts.
9. **Unique Customers per Category**: Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.
10. **Sales by Time Shift**: Categorize sales into shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and analyze the number of orders placed during each shift.

## Key Insights

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from diverse age groups, with sales distributed across categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: The analysis identifies transactions with significant total sales, highlighting premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly sales trends are analyzed to identify peak seasons and periods of high demand.
- **Customer Insights**: The project identifies top-spending customers and the most popular product categories, offering valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A comprehensive report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and time shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category, helping businesses understand their customer base better.

## Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on introduction to SQL for data analysis, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The insights derived from this analysis can help businesses make informed decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer preferences, and product performance.
